== About the Project
This repository contains a simple application which will register users for upcoming online examinations. NodeJS and ExpressJS based crud API is used to the system implemenation. 

Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers. Docker is an open source tool that ships your application with all the necessary functionalities as one package. The nodejs based app is contanerized and publish the image in docker hub repository.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. EC2 platform is used to deploy the nodejs application. API can accessible through a public IP address.

Hashicorp Terraform is an open-source tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure. It codifies infrastructure in configuration files that describe the topology of cloud resources. Terrafrom is used the infrastructure provisioning in this assignment.


=== Built With
//This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* https://nodejs.org/en/[NodeJS] - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment.
* https://expressjs.com/[ExpressJS] - Express.js is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.
* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] - Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. 
* https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] - Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. 



=== Prerequisites

installed Docker and it is running.


See the https://www.docker.com/[Docker] website for installation instructions.

== Getting Started

Steps to dockerized the API and run locally:



1. Clone this repo

        git clone https://github.com/hasithakeshana/dockerize-nodeapp.git app

3. Locate to the docker-app folder

        cd app/docker app

3. Run the following command to run containers

        docker-compose up

4. Once everything has started up, you should be able to access the api via [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on your host machine.

        open http://localhost:3000/health
        open http://localhost:3000/version



=== Dockerhub repository - Pull the image from dockerhub

Dockerimage of the API has pushed to the dockerhub. 

Steps to pull the image and run the container:


        docker pull hasithakeshana/dockerapi
        
        docker run -p 3000:3000 hasithakeshana/dockerapi


=== Access the API through public IP address - EC2 instance

AWS EC2 free tier instance is used to deploy the nodejs application. API can accessible through a public IP address.

* Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM),EBS General Purpose (SSD) Volume Type

* Instance Type - t2.micro

* Availability zone - us-east-2


Node app is exposed to outside through port 8000.

        open http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/health
        open http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/version



=== API Documentation 

Eight(8) crud API routes are implemented. 

Health Routes

sample input - POST and PUT methods



	{
  	"status":"sample value"
	"type":"sample value"
	}
	



POST - http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/health

GET - http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/health

PUT - http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/health/id

DELETE - http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/health/id

Vesrion Routes

sample input - POST and PUT methods

	{
	"name":"sample",
	"group":"sample value",
	"status":"sample value"
	}

POST - http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/version

GET - http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/version

PUT - http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/version/id

DELETE - http://ec2-18-117-129-232.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/version/id



=== Infrastructure as Code - Terraform

Script to build a ec2 instance with VPC,subnet and security groups.

Steps to run the script:


1. Locate to the terraform script folder

        
        cd terraform script
	
2. When you create a new configuration — or check out an existing configuration from version control — you need to initialize the directory with
	
	terraform init
	
3. create infastructure - Apply the configuration now with the terraform apply command.	
	
	terraform apply
